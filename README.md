This repository maintains the code and jupyter notebook for the dataset.
<P>
  The New York Airbnb open <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data'>dataset</a> is an open dataset for data wrangling, creating visualizations and predicting the prices based on several features that need feature engineering.<br><br>
<P>
  This notebook is a demo project which covers basic EDA as well as feature engineering with PCA. The dataset has many features that can be interpreted for getting insights. Although this is not the finished work, it surely gives feature understanding.
  Here I have visualized the features of the dataset like the correlation between price and the other features, distribution of the price, feature-wise visualizations for understanding the significance of the features. For predictions, I have used linear regression, SVM, and random forest. 
  Although this is the first version and it will be updated from time to time to improve it.
