# NewYork-Airbnb-dataset-visualization-and-prediction
This is a repository to maintain the code and jupyter notebooks for the dataset.
<P>
  The New York Airbnb open <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data'>dataset</a> is an open dataset for data wrangling, creating visualizations and predicting the prices based on several features that need feature engineering.<br><br>
<P>
  This notebook is a demo project which covers basic EDA as well as feature engineering with PCA. The dataset has many features that can interpreted for getting insights. Although this is not some fine and final work but it surely gives the feature understanding.
  Here I have visualized the features of the dataset like correlation between price and the other features, distribution of the price, feature wise visualizations for understanding the significance of the features.For predictions I have used linear regression, SVM and Random forest. 
  Althoguh this is a first version and it will be updated time to time in order to get better.
